# Notes on cleaning data

## The only fields that will prevent the creation of playlists are artist name and song name.  NULLs in other fields are of no concern.
- No NULLs in either artist or song columns
- However, many records have empty strings for these: 11 artists and 542 songs are blank (and only 1 record is blank for both)

## Records where song name is blank
- Context clues help. There is always an artist, if the song is blank (save 1)
- the booelan "is_live" accounts for 66 of these records
- records not marked is_live which still had the artist OR album name include
"live", "Live", or "LIVE", (32, 13, 9) = 54 songs
- or Album was marked "live" (any combo) = 20 songs
- so of 542 songs, 130 songs seemed to be live performances in the studio
- same goes for the word "interview" in artist or album 
- or "compilation" or "V/A" (various artists)
- Release_ID is not null for many of these, which accounts for more
- there are still 226 songs without the clues as above
- 226 of 254,119 song plays in the database is 0.09 percent of the total. very low
- 542 song plays of 254,119 is 0.2 percent
- Conclusion: skip any record without a value in 'song'

## Misspellings of artist names?
- Undesired because Spotify will not be able to find this artist, resulting in songs missing from some playlists.  How to handle these?
- Like names for people, each individual artist has a standard correct spelling for themselves.
- Unlike a database of names of people, we cannot assume that each individual spelling is valid. "Bj√∂rk" and "Bjork" are probably the same artist.  So we want to find and correct these misspellings.  

# Logic, assumptions, volume
- This will be a one-time process to correct archived data
- Find a method that can automatically handle a large amount of the work, then plan to manually process a smaller amount.
- 13,370 unique artist names
- Of these, 5098 appear one time, 1672 appear two times

# Method
- Assume each artist name that appears once is a misspelling
- For each 1-count artist, use fuzzy matching to see if there is a close match whose count is higher than the 1-count.  List all these and make a judgment about how to proceed.
